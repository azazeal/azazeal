Hi there :wave:,

I design & build bespoke distributed systems with [**Go**](https://golang.org) and, at times, [**Ruby**](https://www.ruby-lang.org).

Infrequently, I also teach organizations how to better program and maintain their [**Go**](https://golang.org) codebases.

Currently, I am full-time engaged by the very best of organizations, tasked with solving production identity, but this shouldn't stop you from saying "sup!".

You may read more about me [here](https://panos.nefeloma.io).
